# Internet based Audio Caller

Anytime you stream audio or video over the Web there is a good chance that **WebRTC** might be under the
hood directly or indirectly.

Now, **WebRTC** is an open-source project, it enables realtime streaming (Audio + Video) over
Internet by providing a set of APIs.

That being said there still can be a learning curve while starting out with WebRTC.

If you short on time to deeply understand WebRTC Protocols, or just need a small MVP application
you might be tempted to use a library like **PeerJS**.

**PeerJS** is built on top of WebRTC and hides a lot of low level details from the user.

However, If you are planning to implement something Big and Complex it would make
sense to get **WebRTC** Concepts clear. It would be worth it.

# Trying out the Application

You can run this application locally,

After Cloning,

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

However, it would be a bit difficult to check stuff locally.

You can try out the deployed application for that matter:

**Note:** Microphone permission would be required.

**Note2:** Please use earphones if you would not like to blast yourself with some high pitched echo :)
Earphones would be good!
